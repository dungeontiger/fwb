<div class="para">Fun With Books is a non-profit charitable organization that has been distributing books free of charge to 
youngsters in Leeds and Grenville counties in Ontario, Canada since December 1993. We have two main goals:
<ol>
<li> to instill a love of reading and books in preschoolers so that they will have a better chance of success 
in their years of schooling and working ahead</li>
<li>to encourage children and their parents to spend some time every day reading and experiencing books together</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="para">Six times a year the children in our program receive a new book written, illustrated and printed locally  
which is theirs to keep.  They continue receiving books every second month until they are 5 years old.  Once they reach 5, they receive a graduation certificate and
a letter to the parents encouraging them to keep reading with their children.
</div> 
<div class="para">To be part of our program, a child must be less than 5 and live in Leeds and Grenville.  This is due to the fact that we are funded, 
in part, by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uwleedsgrenville.org/">United Way of Leeds and Grenville</a>. 
If you wish to register one or more of your children, click on <a href="javascript:clickMenu('apply')">Apply</a>.  From there you can 
apply online or print a form that can be mailed in.
</div>
<div class="para">If any of our registered families moves, their books can still be delivered, as long as they are still living in Leeds and 
Grenville.  Please contact Wayne Thomas at 613-924-2611 to notify him of the change in address.</div>
