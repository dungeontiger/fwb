<div class="sectionHeader">About Fun With Books</div>
<div class="para">Fun With Books is a non-profit charitable organization (Charitable Status Number 89643 0949 RT0001)
  that has been distributing books free of charge to youngsters in Leeds and Grenville counties in Ontario, Canada since December 1993.
    Our mission statement consists of two goals:
    <ol>
		<li>to instill a love of reading and books in preschoolers so that they will have a better
     chance of success in their years of schooling and working ahead</li>
     <li>to encourage children and their parents to spend some time
      every day reading and experiencing books together</li>
      </ol>
</div>
<div class="para">The Ontario government's EQAO test results involving children in grades three 
and six have been steadily improving in the past few years.  We believe that participation in Fun With Books
 by many of these children has helped to bring about these successful results.
</div>
<div class="para">In 2010, we started publishing our own books thus encouraging 
the creativity of children and adults in our area.  So far we have published nine titles:  
<span class="bookTitle">The Mystery of the Cat That Ate A Lot</span> by Lauren Boesveld, <span class="bookTitle">Tiger's Big Adventure</span> by Karen McIntyre and Jonathon Ashe,  
<span class="bookTitle">Nathan's Song</span> by Jennifer Mustard and Marian Davison, <span class="bookTitle">Sad Monster and the Wishing Tree</span> by Patrick Guindon,  
<span class="bookTitle">Maritime Ned</span> by Dave Sheridan, <span class="bookTitle">Norman's Blankie</span> by Cheryl Coville, <span class="bookTitle">Where is Christmas?</span> by Julie Larose,  
<span class="bookTitle">After the Rainbow</span> by Laurie Young and Margaret Axcell, and <span class="bookTitle">Hannah's Little Red Wheelbarrow</span> by Emily Schaafsma and Michelle Reid.  
Our goal is to include one of these homegrown titles in all of our book packages. 
</div>
<div class="para">We started Fun With Books in December 1993 with about 400 children registered.
Presently over 80 volunteers deliver book packages to over 1700 children in about 1600 families throughout the United Counties of 
Leeds and Grenville here in eastern Ontario.  Each package contains one of our homegrown books and a newsletter.  
The newsletter includes information to parents about books and reading on one side, and a picture to colour or a puzzle to complete for the child on the other side.  
These book packages are packed at Thousand Islands Secondary School in Brockville by another group of about 10 to 15 volunteers. 
As you can see, we are very proud that our project is carried out completely by an enthusiastic team of volunteers.
One of our volunteers co-ordinates the updating of our computer list of children and the delivery of book packages to the people who deliver the packages to the children's homes.

When a child reaches the age of five, we send him/her one more book package that 
includes a graduation certificate and a letter to the parents encouraging them to continue reading with their child.  
</div>
<div class="para">
Since December 1993 over 500,000 books have been distributed to children in Leeds and Grenville counties.
</div>
<div class="para">
About a quarter of our funding comes from the United Way of Leeds and Grenville. 
 We also receive donations from service organizations, individuals, businesses, and foundations. 
  We sell sponsorships that appear on the inside front and back covers of the books we publish from time to time. Rates for these sponsorships are available on the <a href="javascript:clickMenu('sponsoring')">sponsoring</a> page.  As well, we run a home games event fundraiser in the spring and are always looking to find other sources of income.
