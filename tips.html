  <li>Reading is hard! Encourage your child to try, even if it's not right every time.
  <li>Practise letter sounds together. Practise writing and reading letters and words.
  <li>When you get to a word your child doesn't know, look together for clues in the pictures that might provide the answer.
  <li>If your child has trouble reading a word, skip over it, read the rest of the sentence, and try to determine what word might make sense.
  <li>Choose books that rhyme, that repeat familiar phrases, or that have a predictable story.
  <li>Applaud your child's efforts! Don't dwell on mistakes, and give plenty of encouragement. Every new word your child learns is a step toward reading and deserves your attention and praise.

<div class="subSectionHeader">Explore Reading With Your Child</div>
<ul>
  <li>Keep books, magazines, and newspapers in your home to give your child constant exposure to reading possibilities.
  <li>Tape label names on objects in your home such as bed, doll, table, or chair. This can help your child begin to recognize letters and words.
  <li>Help your child see how people use reading and writing through daily events such as reading a recipe while preparing a meal, reading aloud cards and letters, and writing lists or cheques.
  <li>Work on your home computer. This can show your child a variety of information in many different forms.
  <li>Outside the home, point out signs, labels, and logos to your child. This can encourage early attempts at reading. Even the youngest child will quickly begin to identify familiar signs and places.
  <li>Visit libraries, bookstores, newsstands, and other places where books and other reading materials are found. Ask for help in choosing books your child will like.
</ul>
<div class="subSectionHeader">The Time for Books is All the Time</div>
<ul>
  <li>Keep a library in your child's room to teach him or her that books are an important part of your home environment. If possible, include colorful picture books, interactive books with exciting features, nursery rhymes and fairy tales, joke or riddle books, or homemade books.
  <li>Select a special reading place like a rocking chair, a soft rug, or a comfortable couch to create a warm and inviting reading environment. Whenever possible, hold your child in your lap as you read. Let him or her hold the book and turn the pages.
  <li>Familiarize yourself with the book before reading it. This will make you a better storyteller. You can make the reading experience special for your child by taking time to ask and answer questions, reading slowly and clearly, holding the book so your child can see the pictures and words, and making the story interesting with different character voices and sounds.
