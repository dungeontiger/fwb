Fun With Books wants to encourage writers as well as readers! We have started a children's book publishing program. 
Authors and illustrators can collaborate to write a children's book of 16 pages in length. 
After passing our editorial review and being accepted, Fun With Books will publish approximately 2,000 copies and distribute it to each of our families. 
It's a great way for authors to get exposure and it's a great way for kids to read new and original stories.

To be accepted, a book must be appropriate for ages 0 to 5 and the writer and/or illustrator must own all copyrights to the work. 
If you are an illustrator or writer and are interested in having your work published by Fun With Books and distributed, please contact us at 
<a href="mailto:info@funwithbooks.org">info@funwithbooks.org</a>. It is important to note that there is no cost to the author. This is part of our service to the community. 
Donations are of course welcome, but not required to have your work published.

<div class="para">Once we have distributed a book to each family, the remaining copies may be sold at $8 each.  Half of this amount for go to Fun With Books to fund future
programs and half will be given to the author and illustrator.</div>
