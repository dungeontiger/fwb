<div class="sectionHeader">Fund Raising</div>

<div class="para">
Our annual budget is about $40,000. About a quarter of our funding comes from the United Way of Leeds and Grenville. We also receive donations from individuals, businesses, and foundations. 
We sell sponsorships for the books we publish six times per year. Rates for these sponsorships are available on the <a href="javascript:clickMenu('sponsoring')">sponsoring</a> page.

<div class="para">
Since 2011 our financial situation has made it necessary for us to deliver books every other month. 
This cuts our annual budget in half. Of course the annual budget also varies according to the number of 
children receiving books.  We intend to return to providing books every month once our financial situation allows that.

<div class="para">
We regularly approach service groups, foundations and businesses for donations, but in these tough economic times, it is difficult to get financing.
We are hoping, therefore, that the families who receive our books will be interested in <span class="bold">planning small fundraisers</span> to assist us financially. 
One suggestion is to hold a games tournament, playing Scrabble or other board games, and charge a participation fee for those who come to play. 
This could be done at home with friends and relatives, or even during lunch hour in the work place. <span class="bold"> Our target dates for this campaign are the months 
of March, April and May. </span> You can use this form to record your tournament:
